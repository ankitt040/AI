							CS561: Assignment 2

A local search algorithm tries to find the optimal solution by exploring the states in local region.
Hill climbing is a local search technique which always looks for a better solution in its neighborhood.
Implement Hill climbing search algorithm for solving the 8-puzzle problem.

Notes:
1. Input is given in a file in the following format. Read the input and store the information in a matrix. 
Configuration of start and goal state can be anything.
Start State
 T6 T7 T3
 T8 T4 T2
 T1 B T5
Goal State
 T1 T2 T3
 T4 T5 T6
 T7 T8 B
 where T1, T2, ..., T8 are the tiles number and B is blank space.

3. Output should have following information
   3.1:On success
	 a. Success message
	 b. Start state
	 c. Goal state
	 d. (Sub)Optimal Path
	 e. (Sub)Optimal Cost of the path.
	 f. Total number of states explored.
   3.2:On failure
	 a. Failure message
	 b. Start state
	 c. Goal state
